# labview-cdev-surface

Canonical governance surface for deterministic `C:\dev` workspace provisioning.

Build and gate lanes run with an always-isolated workspace policy:
- `git-worktree` primary provisioning
- detached-clone fallback
- deterministic root selection (`D:\dev` preferred, `C:\dev` fallback)
- git trust bootstrap via `scripts\Ensure-GitSafeDirectories.ps1` (including worktrees)
- cleanup runs under `if: always()` after artifact upload
- published installer defaults remain unchanged (`ci-only-selector`)

This repository owns:
- `workspace-governance.json` (machine-readable remote/branch/commit contract)
- `workspace-governance-payload\workspace-governance\*` (canonical payload copied into `C:\dev` by installer runtime)
- `workspace-governance-payload\tools\cdev-cli\*` (bundled control-plane CLI assets for offline deterministic operation)
- `AGENTS.md` (human policy contract)
- validation scripts in `scripts/`
- drift and contract workflows in `.github/workflows/`

## CLI-first control plane

Preferred operator interface:

```powershell
pwsh -NoProfile -File C:\dev\tools\cdev-cli\win-x64\cdev-cli\scripts\Invoke-CdevCli.ps1 help
```

Core commands:
- `repos doctor`
- `installer exercise`
- `installer install --mode release`
- `installer upgrade`
- `installer rollback`
- `postactions collect`
- `linux deploy-ni --docker-context desktop-linux --image nationalinstruments/labview:latest-linux`

The NSIS payload bundles pinned CLI assets for both `win-x64` and `linux-x64` and release preflight verifies their hashes against `workspace-governance.json`.

## Core release signal

`Workspace SHA Drift Signal` runs on a schedule and on demand. It fails when any governed repo default branch SHA differs from its `pinned_sha` in `workspace-governance.json`.

`Workspace SHA Refresh PR` is the default remediation workflow. It updates `pinned_sha` values, reuses branch `automation/sha-refresh`, and creates or updates a single refresh PR to `main`.

Auto-refresh policy:
1. Auto-merge is enabled by default for refresh PRs with squash strategy.
2. Maintainer approval is not required for `labview-cdev-surface` refresh merges (`required_approving_review_count = 0`).
3. Required status checks remain strict (`CI Pipeline`, `Workspace Installer Contract`, `Reproducibility Contract`, `Provenance Contract`).
4. `workspace-sha-drift-signal.yml` uses `WORKFLOW_BOT_TOKEN` for cross-repo default-branch SHA reads.
5. `workspace-sha-refresh-pr.yml` requires repository secret `WORKFLOW_BOT_TOKEN` for branch mutation and PR operations.
6. If `WORKFLOW_BOT_TOKEN` is missing or misconfigured, refresh automation fails fast with an explicit error.
7. Refresh CI propagation is PR-event-driven; refresh automation does not explicitly dispatch `ci.yml`.
8. Manual refresh PR flow is fallback only for platform outages, not routine check propagation.

## Local checks

```powershell
pwsh -NoProfile -File .\scripts\Test-WorkspaceManifestBranchDrift.ps1 `
  -ManifestPath .\workspace-governance.json `
  -OutputPath .\artifacts\workspace-drift\workspace-drift-report.json
```

```powershell
pwsh -NoProfile -File .\scripts\Test-PolicyContracts.ps1 `
  -WorkspaceRoot C:\dev `
  -FailOnWarning
```

## Local NSIS refinement (fast iteration)

Run a fast local iteration (build + transfer bundle, skip smoke install):

```powershell
pwsh -NoProfile -File .\scripts\Invoke-WorkspaceInstallerIteration.ps1 `
  -Mode fast `
  -Iterations 1
```

Prerequisites for full installer qualification:
- LabVIEW 2020 (32-bit and 64-bit) installed for PPL capability.
- LabVIEW 2020 (64-bit) installed for VIP capability.
- `g-cli`, `git`, `gh`, `pwsh`, and `dotnet` available on PATH.
- NSIS installed at `C:\Program Files (x86)\NSIS` (or pass an override).

Run a full local qualification (build + isolated smoke install + bundle):

```powershell
pwsh -NoProfile -File .\scripts\Invoke-WorkspaceInstallerIteration.ps1 `
  -Mode full `
  -Iterations 1
```

Watch mode for agent iteration without manual reruns:

```powershell
pwsh -NoProfile -File .\scripts\Invoke-WorkspaceInstallerIteration.ps1 `
  -Mode fast `
  -Watch `
  -PollSeconds 10 `
  -MaxRuns 10
```

## Build in CI

`CI Pipeline` always runs on GitHub-hosted Linux and is the required merge check.

Self-hosted contract jobs are opt-in via repository variable `ENABLE_SELF_HOSTED_CONTRACTS=true`.
If no self-hosted runner is configured, these jobs stay skipped and do not block merge policy.
The workflow uses concurrency dedupe keyed by workflow/repo/ref to avoid duplicate active runs on the same branch.

When enabled, `Workspace Installer Contract` compiles:
- `lvie-cdev-workspace-installer.exe`

The job stages a deterministic workspace payload, builds a manifest-pinned `runner-cli` bundle, and validates that NSIS build tooling can produce the installer on the self-hosted Windows lane.
Installer runtime is a hard gate for post-install capability in this order:
1. `runner-cli ppl build` with LabVIEW 2020 x86.
2. `runner-cli ppl build` with LabVIEW 2020 x64.
3. `runner-cli vipc assert/apply/assert` and `runner-cli vip build` with LabVIEW 2020 x64.

Additional supply-chain contract jobs:
- `Reproducibility Contract`: validates bit-for-bit determinism for `runner-cli` bundles (`win-x64`, `linux-x64`) and installer output.
- `Provenance Contract`: generates and validates SPDX + SLSA provenance artifacts linked to installer/bundle/manifest hashes.

## Integration gate

`integration-gate.yml` provides a single `Integration Gate` context for `integration/*` branches (and manual dispatch).  
It polls commit statuses and only passes when these contexts are successful:
- `CI Pipeline`
- `Workspace Installer Contract`
- `Reproducibility Contract`
- `Provenance Contract`

## Installer harness (self-hosted)

`installer-harness-self-hosted.yml` runs deterministic installer qualification on `self-hosted-windows-lv` with dedicated label `installer-harness` for:
- `push` to `integration/*`
- `workflow_dispatch` (optional `ref` override)

The harness run sequence:
1. Runner baseline lock (`Assert-InstallerHarnessRunnerBaseline.ps1`)
2. Machine preflight pack (`Assert-InstallerHarnessMachinePreflight.ps1`)
3. Full local iteration (`Invoke-WorkspaceInstallerIteration.ps1 -Mode full -Iterations 1`)
4. Report validation for smoke post-actions:
   - `ppl_capability_checks.32 == pass`
   - `ppl_capability_checks.64 == pass`
   - `vip_package_build_check == pass`

Published evidence artifacts include:
- `iteration-summary.json`
- `exercise-report.json`
- `workspace-install-latest.json` (smoke)
- `lvie-cdev-workspace-installer-bundle.zip`
- `harness-validation-report.json`

Promotion policy:
1. Keep `Installer Harness` non-required initially.
2. Promote to required check after 3 consecutive green integration runs and at least 1 green manual dispatch run.

Runner drift recovery (only when baseline lock fails):

```powershell
$token = gh api -X POST repos/LabVIEW-Community-CI-CD/labview-cdev-surface/actions/runners/registration-token --jq .token

Set-Location C:\actions-runner-cdev
.\config.cmd --url https://github.com/LabVIEW-Community-CI-CD/labview-cdev-surface --token $token --name DESKTOP-6Q81H4O-cdev-surface --labels self-hosted,windows,self-hosted-windows-lv --work _work --unattended --replace --runasservice

Set-Location C:\actions-runner-cdev-2
.\config.cmd --url https://github.com/LabVIEW-Community-CI-CD/labview-cdev-surface --token $token --name DESKTOP-6Q81H4O-cdev-surface-2 --labels self-hosted,windows,self-hosted-windows-lv,windows-containers --work _work --unattended --replace --runasservice

Set-Location C:\actions-runner-cdev-harness2
.\config.cmd --url https://github.com/LabVIEW-Community-CI-CD/labview-cdev-surface --token $token --name DESKTOP-6Q81H4O-cdev-surface-harness --labels self-hosted,windows,self-hosted-windows-lv,installer-harness --work _work --unattended --replace
Start-Process -FilePath cmd.exe -ArgumentList '/c run.cmd' -WorkingDirectory C:\actions-runner-cdev-harness2 -WindowStyle Minimized
```

Artifact upload reliability:
1. Self-hosted artifact uploads run with deterministic two-attempt retry behavior.
2. Operator escalation is required only when both upload attempts fail.

## Post-gate extension (Docker Desktop Windows image)

After the installer hard gate is consistently green, extend CI with a Docker Desktop Windows-image lane that:
1. Installs the workspace via `lvie-cdev-workspace-installer.exe /S`.
2. Uses bundled `runner-cli` from the installed workspace.
3. Runs `runner-cli ppl build` and `runner-cli vip build` on the LabVIEW-enabled Windows image.
4. Fails the lane on command-surface regressions or PPL/VIP capability loss.

## Fast Docker Desktop Linux iteration

Use local Docker Desktop Linux mode to iterate faster on runner-cli command-surface and policy contracts before running the full Windows LabVIEW image lane:

```powershell
pwsh -NoProfile -File .\scripts\Invoke-DockerDesktopLinuxIteration.ps1 `
  -DockerContext desktop-linux `
  -Runtime linux-x64 `
  -Image mcr.microsoft.com/powershell:7.4-ubuntu-22.04
```

This lane bundles manifest-pinned `runner-cli` for `linux-x64`, runs `runner-cli --help` and `runner-cli ppl --help` inside the container, and optionally executes core Pester contract tests.
If Docker Desktop cannot start, verify Windows virtualization features are enabled (`Microsoft-Hyper-V-All`, `VirtualMachinePlatform`, `Microsoft-Windows-Subsystem-Linux`) and reboot after feature changes.

## Publish Release (Automated Gate)

Use manual workflow dispatch for release publication:
1. Run `.github/workflows/release-with-windows-gate.yml`.
2. Provide a new `release_tag` in semantic format (for example, `v0.1.1`).
3. Keep `allow_existing_tag=false` (default). Set `true` only for break-glass overwrite operations.
4. Set `prerelease` as needed.
5. Keep `allow_gate_override=false` (default).

Automated flow:
1. `repo_guard` verifies release runs only in `LabVIEW-Community-CI-CD/labview-cdev-surface`.
2. `windows_gate` runs Windows-container installer acceptance.
3. `gate_policy` hard-blocks publish on gate failure.
4. `release_publish` runs only when gate policy succeeds.

Controlled override (exception only):
1. Set `allow_gate_override=true`.
2. Provide non-empty `override_reason`.
3. Provide `override_incident_url` pointing to a GitHub issue/discussion.
4. Workflow appends an "Override Disclosure" section to release notes.

Release packaging still:
- Builds `lvie-cdev-workspace-installer.exe`.
- Signs installer when signing certificate secrets are configured.
- Computes SHA256.
- Runs determinism gates and fails on hash drift.
- Generates `workspace-installer.spdx.json` and `workspace-installer.slsa.json`.
- Generates `release-manifest.json`.
- Creates the GitHub release if missing and binds the tag to the exact workflow commit SHA.
- Uploads installer + SHA + provenance + reproducibility + `release-manifest.json` assets to the release.
- Writes release notes including SHA256 and the install command:

```powershell
lvie-cdev-workspace-installer.exe /S
```

Verify downloaded asset integrity by matching the local hash against the SHA256 value published in the release notes.
Tag immutability policy: existing release tags fail by default to prevent mutable release history.
Fallback entrypoint: `.github/workflows/release-workspace-installer.yml` (wrapper to `_release-workspace-installer-core.yml`).

## Install from Upstream Release (Release Client)

Use the release client runtime for one-command install/upgrade/rollback from release assets:

```powershell
pwsh -NoProfile -File .\scripts\Install-WorkspaceInstallerFromRelease.ps1 `
  -Mode Install `
  -Channel stable
```

Install a specific release tag:

```powershell
pwsh -NoProfile -File .\scripts\Install-WorkspaceInstallerFromRelease.ps1 `
  -Mode Install `
  -Tag v0.1.1
```

Upgrade from the current state file to latest stable:

```powershell
pwsh -NoProfile -File .\scripts\Install-WorkspaceInstallerFromRelease.ps1 `
  -Mode Upgrade `
  -Channel stable
```

Rollback to previous release state:

```powershell
pwsh -NoProfile -File .\scripts\Install-WorkspaceInstallerFromRelease.ps1 `
  -Mode Rollback `
  -RollbackTo previous
```

Validate local release policy file:

```powershell
pwsh -NoProfile -File .\scripts\Install-WorkspaceInstallerFromRelease.ps1 `
  -Mode ValidatePolicy
```

Release client contract paths:
- Policy: `C:\dev\workspace-governance\release-policy.json`
- State: `C:\dev\artifacts\workspace-release-state.json`
- Latest report: `C:\dev\artifacts\workspace-release-client-latest.json`

Default allowed installer release repositories:
- `LabVIEW-Community-CI-CD/labview-cdev-surface`
- `svelderrainruiz/labview-cdev-surface`

Fork/upstream cdev-cli synchronization policy starts with full sync metadata:
- Primary CLI repo: `svelderrainruiz/labview-cdev-cli`
- Mirror repo: `LabVIEW-Community-CI-CD/labview-cdev-cli`
- Strategy: `fork-and-upstream-full-sync`

Release channel metadata can be set during publish with workflow input `release_channel` (`stable`, `prerelease`, `canary`).

## Ops monitoring and hygiene

`ops-monitoring.yml` is scheduled hourly and supports manual dispatch. It runs `scripts/Invoke-OpsMonitoringSnapshot.ps1` and fails on:
- runner availability drift (`runner_unavailable`)
- cdev-cli sync-guard drift/failure (`sync_guard_failed`, `sync_guard_stale`, `sync_guard_missing`, `sync_guard_incomplete`)

Every run uploads `ops-monitoring-report.json`. On failure, automation updates a single tracking issue (`Ops Monitoring Alert`).

`canary-smoke-tag-hygiene.yml` is scheduled daily and supports manual dispatch. It runs `scripts/Invoke-CanarySmokeTagHygiene.ps1` to keep latest `v0.YYYYMMDD.N` canary smoke tag(s) for a UTC date and delete older tags deterministically.

`ops-autoremediate.yml` is scheduled hourly and supports manual dispatch. It runs `scripts/Invoke-OpsAutoRemediation.ps1` to:
- auto-dispatch and verify cdev-cli sync-guard when sync drift is detected
- re-evaluate health after remediation
- fail with deterministic reason codes when manual intervention is still required

`release-control-plane.yml` is the autonomous orchestrator. It runs `scripts/Invoke-ReleaseControlPlane.ps1` with modes:
- `CanaryCycle`
- `PromotePrerelease`
- `PromoteStable`
- `FullCycle`
- `Validate`

Control-plane behavior:
1. Runs ops health gate and optional auto-remediation.
2. Dispatches release workflow with deterministic channel-specific tag windows (`canary=1-49`, `prerelease=50-79`, `stable=80-99` for `v0.YYYYMMDD.N`).
3. Verifies run completion.
4. Applies canary smoke tag hygiene after canary publish.

`weekly-ops-slo-report.yml` emits machine-readable weekly SLO evidence via `scripts/Write-OpsSloReport.ps1`.

Runbook for incidents:
- `docs/runbooks/release-ops-incident-response.md`

## Nightly canary

`nightly-supplychain-canary.yml` runs on a nightly schedule and on demand. It executes:
1. Docker Desktop Linux iteration (`desktop-linux` context).
2. Runner-cli determinism checks (`win-x64` and `linux-x64`).
3. Installer determinism check.

On failure, it updates a single tracking issue (`Nightly Supply-Chain Canary Failure`) with the failing run link.

## Windows LabVIEW image gate

`windows-labview-image-gate.yml` is dispatch-only and wraps `./.github/workflows/_windows-labview-image-gate-core.yml` for standalone diagnostics.  
The core gate requires the runner to already be in Windows container mode (non-interactive CI does not switch Docker engine), validates host/image OS-version compatibility via `docker manifest inspect --verbose`, then pulls `nationalinstruments/labview:2026q1-windows` by default (override with repo variable `LABVIEW_WINDOWS_IMAGE`), installs the NSIS workspace installer in-container, runs bundled `runner-cli ppl build` and `runner-cli vip build`, and verifies PPL + VIP output presence.
The core gate is pinned to dedicated labels so it runs only on the intended user-session runner lane: `self-hosted`, `windows`, `self-hosted-windows-lv`, `windows-containers`, `user-session`, `cdev-surface-windows-gate`.
Isolation behavior is controlled by `LABVIEW_WINDOWS_DOCKER_ISOLATION`:
1. `auto` (default): process isolation when host/image OS versions match, automatic Hyper-V fallback on mismatch.
2. `process`: strict process isolation only (mismatch fails).
3. `hyperv`: force Hyper-V isolation.

### Windows feature troubleshooting reporting

When validating `Microsoft-Hyper-V` and `Containers` feature setup for Docker Desktop:
1. Classify `Enable-WindowsOptionalFeature ... -NoRestart` warning output as informational.
2. Verify features with a per-feature loop (single `-FeatureName` per call), not by passing an array directly.
3. Emit these explicit reporting fields: `features_enabled`, `reboot_pending`, `docker_daemon_ready`.
